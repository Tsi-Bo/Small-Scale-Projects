# Small Scale Projects
## _A reccord of personal projects_

This website is a collection of small to medium sized projects I'm actively working on during my learning process. 

It contains :

- Basic web development languages like HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
- Documentation and explanations associated with the projects.
- Front-End development ideas.

## How is it important ? 

- Keeps a chronological reccord of my progress over the months.
- Gives a direct and "tangible" overview of my understanding of programming languages.
- Motivates me by showcasing the work and making it accessible to anyone.

## Courses undertaken

 Driven by an exponential motivation ang guided by mentors in the field, I decided to go on a self-taught journey. Here are the courses I have undertaken during the last couple of months.
