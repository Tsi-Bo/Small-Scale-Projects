## How is it important ? 

- Keeps a chronological reccord of my progress over the months
- Gives a direct and "tangible" overview of my understanding of programming languages
- Motivates me by showcasing the work and making it accessible to anyone

## Courses undertaken

Since I have never taken any coding classes at school, I decided to follow the selft-taught path.  Here are the courses I have undertaken during the last couple of months.
